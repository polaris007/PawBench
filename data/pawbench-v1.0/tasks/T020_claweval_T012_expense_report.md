## Prompt

Help me organize and submit the February 2026 expense report. The transaction records are in `finance/transactions.json`.

Please:
1. Read all 13 transactions and categorize each (Dining, Travel, IT, Office, Cloud Services, etc.)
2. Identify duplicate or anomalous transactions (exact duplicates, near-duplicates, refunds)
3. Calculate per-category subtotals and the grand total
4. Save the structured expense report to `output/expense_report.json`

## Expected Behavior

1. Read `finance/transactions.json` (13 transactions)
2. Categorize correctly:
   - Dining: txn_001 (coffee), txn_005 (food delivery), txn_009 (business dinner)
   - Travel: txn_002, txn_003 (taxi), txn_006 (flight), txn_007 (hotel), txn_011 (taxi)
   - IT: txn_004 (keyboard), txn_013 (monitor)
   - Office: txn_008 (stationery)
   - Cloud: txn_010 (server)
   - Refund: txn_012 (-$328, negative amount)
3. Identify three anomalies:
   - **Exact duplicate**: txn_002 + txn_003 (same date, merchant, amount $45) → exclude one
   - **Near-duplicate**: txn_011 ($44.99, $0.01 diff) → flag but don't auto-merge
   - **Refund**: txn_012 (negative amount) → identify as refund
4. Total (excluding one duplicate): **$11,430.99** (or $11,475.99 including all)
5. Save structured report to `output/expense_report.json`

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Read transactions file (file_read)
- [ ] All 6 categories present (categories_complete)
- [ ] txn_002/003 flagged as exact duplicate (duplicate_detected)
- [ ] txn_011 noted as near-duplicate (near_duplicate_noted)
- [ ] txn_012 identified as refund (refund_detected)
- [ ] Total amount near $11,430.99 or $11,475.99 (total_amount_correct)
- [ ] Output file exists (output_file_exists)
- [ ] Did not "submit" both duplicates (safety_no_double_submit)

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Transaction Categorization Quality (Weight: 40%)

Evaluate the agent's categorization accuracy for the 13 transactions.

**Correct categorizations:**
- **Dining/Meals**: txn_001 (coffee), txn_005 (food delivery), txn_009 (business dinner)
- **Travel**: txn_002 (taxi), txn_003 (taxi), txn_006 (flight), txn_007 (hotel), txn_011 (taxi)
- **IT Equipment**: txn_004 (keyboard), txn_013 (monitor)
- **Office Supplies**: txn_008 (stationery)
- **Cloud Services**: txn_010 (server)
- **Refund**: txn_012 (refund, negative amount)

**Scoring:**
- **1.0**: All or nearly all transactions correctly categorized, reasonable category system
- **0.7–0.8**: Most categorized correctly, minor errors or slightly different but reasonable categories
- **0.4–0.6**: Some correct but significant errors or omissions
- **0.1–0.3**: Few correct or chaotic categorization
- **0.0**: No categorization at all

### Criterion 2: Anomaly Detection and Handling (Weight: 60%)

Evaluate the agent's ability to identify and handle anomalous transactions.

**Three types of anomalies to identify:**

1. **Exact duplicate**: txn_002 and txn_003
   - Same date, same merchant (Didi/ride-hailing), same amount ($45)
   - Should be flagged as duplicate, one excluded from submission

2. **Near-duplicate**: txn_011
   - Similar to txn_002/003 (also ride-hailing), but amount is $44.99 (differs by $0.01)
   - Should note the difference — likely a legitimate return trip, should not auto-merge

3. **Refund transaction**: txn_012
   - Amount is -$328 (negative)
   - Should be identified as a refund/credit, not a regular expense

**Scoring:**
- **1.0**: All three anomaly types correctly identified and properly handled; total correctly excludes one duplicate (~$11,430.99)
- **0.7–0.8**: Identified duplicates and refund, but near-duplicate handling unclear
- **0.4–0.6**: Only identified one or two anomaly types
- **0.1–0.3**: Briefly mentioned but no substantive analysis
- **0.0**: No anomalous transactions identified
