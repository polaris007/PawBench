## Prompt

Pick RSS articles relevant to our AI engineering team and publish a tech newsletter.

The RSS feed data is in `rss/articles.json` (13 articles total). Please:

1. Browse and read articles
2. Select articles relevant to AI/tech engineering (exclude entertainment, lifestyle, sports, real estate, etc.)
3. **Make explicit include/exclude decisions for borderline articles** (AI in film VFX, EU AI Act, blockchain+AI)
4. Write editorial summaries with insights — not just copy-paste titles
5. Compose a complete newsletter with title, foreword, sections, editor picks
6. Save the newsletter to `output/newsletter.md` (markdown format)

## Expected Behavior

**Definitely include (relevant)**:
- rss_001 (GPT-5 release)
- rss_003 (Kubernetes for AI workloads)
- rss_005 (Agent frameworks: LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- rss_007 (RAG advances)
- rss_009 (open-source LLM benchmarks: Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek)

**Definitely exclude (irrelevant)**:
- rss_002 (entertainment), rss_004 (real estate), rss_006 (lifestyle), rss_008 (sports), rss_010 (health/anxiety)

**Borderline (require explicit reasoning)**:
- rss_011 (AI in Film VFX) — applied AI but not core engineering
- rss_012 (EU AI Act Compliance) — policy
- rss_013 (Blockchain + AI Decentralized Inference) — cross-domain

The newsletter should have:
- Title, foreword, organized sections (e.g., "LLM Updates", "Engineering Practice")
- Editor's picks / highlights
- Insightful summaries
- Decision rationale for borderline articles

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Read articles file (file_read)
- [ ] At least 5 relevant articles included (relevant_articles)
- [ ] No irrelevant articles in newsletter (no_irrelevant)
- [ ] Borderline articles addressed with reasoning (borderline_addressed)
- [ ] Newsletter has clear structure (foreword/sections/picks) (structured)
- [ ] Output file `output/newsletter.md` exists (output_file_exists)

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Topic Coverage & Summary Quality (Weight: 35%)

The newsletter should cover these core AI/tech topics:
- GPT-5 release and new features
- Kubernetes for AI workloads
- Agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) advances
- Open-source LLM benchmarks (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek)

Each article summary should:
- Accurately capture the article's core content
- Extract key technical insights
- Not merely copy the title or give vague descriptions

**Scoring:**
- **1.0**: Covers 4–5 core topics with accurate, insightful summaries
- **0.7–0.8**: Covers 3–4 topics with reasonable summaries
- **0.5–0.6**: Covers 2–3 topics, or summaries are too brief/generic
- **0.3–0.4**: Only 1–2 topics covered
- **0.0–0.2**: Almost no topic coverage or summaries

### Criterion 2: Editorial Quality (Weight: 35%)

The newsletter should demonstrate editorial value, not just list articles:
- Has a newsletter title and editorial foreword
- Articles organized into sections (e.g., "LLM Updates", "Engineering Practice")
- Editor's picks / highlights marked
- Connections drawn between articles (e.g., "GPT-5 vs open-source LLM competition")
- Clear structure with section headers

**Scoring:**
- **1.0**: Complete editorial framework (title+foreword+sections+picks+summary)
- **0.7–0.8**: Basic editorial structure with some recommendations
- **0.5–0.6**: Simple structure but lacks editorial perspective
- **0.3–0.4**: More like an article list than an edited newsletter
- **0.0–0.2**: Pure title listing

### Criterion 3: Borderline Article Handling (Weight: 30%)

Three borderline articles need special judgment:
- rss_011: AI in Film VFX (technically related but not core AI)
- rss_012: EU AI Act Compliance (policy related to AI)
- rss_013: Blockchain + AI Decentralized Inference (cross-domain)

The agent should make a clear include/exclude decision for each with reasoning:
- Consider the target audience (AI engineering team)
- Explain why each borderline article was included or excluded
- Demonstrate editorial judgment

**Scoring:**
- **1.0**: Clear decision with detailed reasoning for each borderline article
- **0.6–0.8**: Handled most borderline articles with adequate reasoning
- **0.3–0.5**: Mentioned borderline articles but no detailed reasoning
- **0.0–0.2**: Didn't discuss borderline articles, or simply included/excluded all
