## Prompt

The workspace contains a reference subway-map image:
- `fixtures/metro1.png` — the **southern portion of the New York City subway map**, covering lower Manhattan and Brooklyn

Please first view the image, then generate `output/output.html` reproducing this metro map using **inline SVG**:

1. Render the major NYC subway lines with **correct colors**:
   - Lines 1/2/3 — RED (west side / 7th Ave)
   - Lines 4/5/6 — GREEN (east side / Lexington Ave)
   - Lines A/C/E — BLUE (8th Ave)
   - Lines N/Q/R — YELLOW (Broadway)
   - Lines D/F — ORANGE (6th Ave)
   - Lines J/M/Z — BROWN (Williamsburg Bridge)
   - Line G — LIGHT GREEN (Brooklyn only)
   - Line 7 — PURPLE (top, to Queens)
   - PATH trains — dashed lines to New Jersey
2. Label key transfer hubs and stations:
   - West 4 St / Washington Sq, Canal St, Fulton St, Brooklyn Bridge / Chambers St, WTC, Atlantic Av, Borough Hall, Court St, Jay St MetroTech, South Ferry / Whitehall St, Battery Park area
3. Layout: **Manhattan on the LEFT**, **Brooklyn on the RIGHT**, separated by the East River; lines crossing the river via bridges/tunnels
4. Background a grayish-blue with `Brooklyn` in large text on the right side
5. Show transfer stations with multi-line markers; ensure station labels are legible

Save the result to `output/output.html` (a self-contained HTML file with inline SVG).

## Expected Behavior

- Read `fixtures/metro1.png`
- Build inline SVG with colored polylines for each subway line, with circles/squares for stations
- Add text labels for stations and `Brooklyn` background label
- Save to `output/output.html`

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Reads reference PNG (file_read)
- [ ] Output HTML exists with inline SVG (output_file_exists, has_svg)
- [ ] Major line colors present (line_colors)
- [ ] Key station labels present (stations_labeled)
- [ ] Manhattan/Brooklyn layout indicated (layout_correct)
- [ ] Substantial output (>5KB) (substantial_output)

- Borough Hall, Court St, Jay St MetroTech — Brooklyn downtown
- South Ferry / Whitehall St — southern tip of Manhattan
- Battery Park — bottom-left of Manhattan

**Layout:**
- Manhattan on the LEFT, Brooklyn on the RIGHT
- East River separates them; lines cross via bridges/tunnels
- Background grayish-blue, with `Brooklyn` labeled in large text

**Scoring bands:**
- **0.7–1.0**: Most key stations labeled correctly + correct geographic layout
- **0.4–0.7**: Some stations + roughly correct layout
- **0.1–0.4**: Few stations, layout inaccurate
- **0.0**: No recognizable stations

### Criterion 3: Topology & Transfer Markers (Weight: 20%)

- Transfer stations indicated (multi-line markers / shared circles)
- Lines connect at correct stations (e.g., A/C/E/D/F at West 4)
- Visual consistency in line spacing

**Scoring bands:**
- **1.0**: Topology correct, transfers visible
- **0.5–0.8**: Mostly correct
- **0.0–0.4**: Topology incorrect

### Criterion 4: Cleanliness & Legibility (Weight: 10%)

- Station names legible
- Lines don't overlap chaotically
- Overall visual quality

**Scoring bands:**
- **1.0**: Clean, legible map
- **0.5–0.8**: Mostly legible
- **0.0–0.4**: Cluttered or illegible
