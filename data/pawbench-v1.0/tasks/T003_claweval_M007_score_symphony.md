## Prompt

The workspace contains a sheet music image of **Symphony No. 5 Mvt. 1** by Beethoven:
- `fixtures/symphony1.png`

Please first view the image, then generate `output/output.html` reproducing the score using **inline SVG**:

1. Include the title (`Symphony No. 5 Mvt. 1`), composer (`Beethoven`), tempo (`quarter = 170`)
2. Draw two staves (treble + bass) with a brace
3. Display key signature: **C minor** (3 flats — Bb, Eb, Ab); time signature: **2/4**
4. Reproduce **5 measures** containing the famous "Fate" motif (short-short-short-LONG):
   - **M1 (2/4)**: eighth rest + 3 beamed eighth notes on G4 (treble) and G2+G3 octave (bass)
   - **M2 (2/4)**: half note Eb4 (treble) + half note Eb2+Eb3 octave (bass)
   - **M3 (2/4)**: eighth rest + 3 beamed eighth notes on F4 (treble) and F2+F3 octave (bass) — same pattern as M1, but LOWER
   - **M4 (2/4)**: half note D4 with tie to M5 (treble) + half note D2+D3 octave with tie (bass)
   - **M5 (2/4)**: half note D4 continuation (treble); bass clef change to treble at end
5. Visual must show:
   - The "da-da-da-DUM" rhythm: rest + 3 beamed eighth notes, then a held half note
   - Pattern repeats: M1+M2 then M3+M4
   - M1 notes (G4) are higher than M3 notes (F4) — motif steps DOWN
   - Both staves mirror the same rhythmic pattern (octave doubles in bass)
   - Ties between M4 and M5

Save the result to `output/output.html`.

## Expected Behavior

- Read `fixtures/symphony1.png`
- Build a single self-contained HTML file with inline SVG containing all 5 measures
- The "fate" motif visual rhythm should be unmistakable
- Save to `output/output.html`

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Reads reference PNG (file_read)
- [ ] Output HTML exists with inline SVG (output_file_exists, has_svg)
- [ ] Title and composer present (metadata_present)
- [ ] Key (3 flats), time 2/4, clefs (clefs_key_time)
- [ ] Motif rhythm signaled in SVG (motif_rhythm)
- [ ] Pitches G4, F4, Eb4, D4 referenced (motif_pitches)
- [ ] Octave doubling in bass (G2/G3, F2/F3 etc.) (bass_octaves)
- [ ] Ties present for M4–M5 (ties_present)
- [ ] Substantial output (>4KB) (substantial_output)

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: "Fate" Motif Rhythm (Weight: 45%)

**Reference:**
- Title: `Symphony No. 5 Mvt. 1`, Composer: Beethoven, Tempo: quarter = 170
- Key: C minor (3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab); Time: 2/4
- 5 measures, two staves (treble + bass), joined by brace

**The famous "fate" motif (short-short-short-LONG):**

- **M1**: eighth rest + 3 beamed eighth notes — treble all on G4, bass octave G2+G3
- **M2**: one half note — treble on Eb4, bass octave Eb2+Eb3 (held, fills measure)
- **M3**: eighth rest + 3 beamed eighth notes — treble all on F4, bass octave F2+F3 (same pattern as M1, LOWER pitch)
- **M4**: half note treble D4 (with tie to M5), bass octave D2+D3 (with tie)
- **M5**: half note D4 continuation (tie); clef change to treble at end of bass

**KEY FEATURES to verify:**
1. The "da-da-da-DUM" pattern: M1 = rest + 3 beamed eighth notes, M2 = one held note. Repeats: M3 = rest + 3 beamed, M4 = held
2. M1 notes (G4) are HIGHER than M3 notes (F4) — the motif steps DOWN
3. M2 held note (Eb4) is LOWER than M1 notes (G4) — big drop
4. Both staves play the SAME rhythmic pattern (rest+3 in M1,M3; held in M2,M4)
5. Left hand plays octave doubles throughout

**Scoring bands:**
- **0.0–0.2**: Da-da-da-DUM rhythm not recognizable
- **0.2–0.4**: Groups of 3 notes present, but held notes or pitch steps wrong
- **0.4–0.7**: Motif recognizable, pitches or ties inaccurate
- **0.7–1.0**: Short-short-short-LONG pattern with correct pitch descent

### Criterion 2: Notation Detail (Weight: 30%)

- Correct key signature (3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab)
- Time signature 2/4 visible
- Treble + bass clefs
- Ties between M4 and M5
- Octave doubling visible in bass

**Scoring bands:**
- **1.0**: All present and correct
- **0.5–0.8**: Most present, minor issues
- **0.0–0.4**: Significant missing elements

### Criterion 3: Title, Composer, Layout (Weight: 25%)

- Title `Symphony No. 5 Mvt. 1` and composer `Beethoven` text
- Tempo marking (`quarter=170` or equivalent)
- Two-stave layout with brace
- Overall visual match to reference

**Scoring bands:**
- **1.0**: All metadata visible, layout matches
- **0.5–0.8**: Most metadata present
- **0.0–0.4**: Bare or unrecognizable
